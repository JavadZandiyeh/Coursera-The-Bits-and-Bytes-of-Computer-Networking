# 1 Introduction to Networking
## 1.1 The TCP/IP Five-Layer Network Model
To grasp networking, it's essential to understand the components involved, from physical cables to communication protocols. This course focuses on a five-layer model:

1. **Physical Layer**: 
   - Represents physical devices interconnecting computers.
   - Includes networking cables, connectors, and signal transmission specifications.

2. **Data Link Layer**: 
   - Defines a way to interpret signals for device communication.
   - Common protocols: Ethernet, which specifies physical layer attributes and data delivery to nodes on the same network.

3. **Network Layer**: 
   - Allows different networks to communicate via routers.
   - Protocol: IP (Internet Protocol), essential for internet and small network communication.

4. **Transport Layer**: 
   - Ensures data is delivered to the correct applications on nodes.
   - Common protocols: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for reliable delivery, and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for less reliable but faster delivery.

5. **Application Layer**: 
   - Contains application-specific protocols for activities like web browsing and email.
   - These protocols are often the most familiar to users.

**Analogy**: 
- **Physical Layer**: Delivery truck and roads.
- **Data Link Layer**: Moving from one intersection to another.
- **Network Layer**: Deciding which roads to take from address A to B.
- **Transport Layer**: Ensuring the delivery driver knocks on the right door.
- **Application Layer**: The contents of the delivered package.
