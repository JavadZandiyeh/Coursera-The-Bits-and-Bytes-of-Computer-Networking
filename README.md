# The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking ([course link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-networking), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6StTCrZrihE))
This course is designed to provide a full overview of computer networking. We’ll cover everything from the fundamentals of modern networking technologies and protocols to an overview of the cloud to practical applications and network troubleshooting.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to: 
- describe computer networks in terms of a five-layer model
- understand all of the standard protocols involved with TCP/IP communications
- grasp powerful network troubleshooting tools and techniques
- learn network services like DNS and DHCP that help make computer networks run
- understand cloud computing, everything as a service, and cloud storage

## 1. Introduction to Networking
Welcome to the Networking course of the IT Support Professional Certificate! In the first module of this course, we will cover the basics of computer networking. We will learn about the TCP/IP and OSI networking models and how the network layers work together. We'll also cover the basics of networking devices such as cables, hubs and switches, routers, servers and clients. We'll also explore the physical layer and data link layer of our networking model in more detail. By the end of this module, you will know how all the different layers of the network model fit together to create a network.

Learning Objectives:
- Describe how the TCP/IP five layer network model works.
- Identify basic networking devices.
- Label each of the five layers in the TCP/IP network model.
- Describe how the physical layer works.
- Describe how the data link layer works.

## 2. The Network Layer
In the second module of this course, we'll explore the network layer in more depth. We'll learn about the IP addressing scheme and how subnetting works. We'll explore how encapsulation works and how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate. We'll also cover the basics of routing, routing protocols, and how the Internet works. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe the IP addressing scheme, understand how subnetting works, perform binary math to describe subnets, and understand how the Internet works.

Learning Objectives: 
- Describe the IP addressing scheme.
- Describe how subnetting works.
- Describe subnets by performing basic math in binary.
- Demonstrate how encapsulation works.
- Describe how ARP protocols allow different layers of the network to communicate.
- Describe how the Internet works.
- Understand the basics of routing and routing protocols.

## 3. The Transport and Application Layer
In the third module of this course, we'll explore the transport and application layers. By the end of this module, you'll be able to describe TCP ports and sockets, identify the different components of a TCP header, show the difference between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols, and explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity.

Learning Objectives:
- Describe TCP ports and sockets.
- Examine the different components of a TCP header.
- Compare differences between connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.
- Explain how TCP is used to ensure data integrity.

## 4. Networking Services
In the fourth module of this course, we'll explore networking services. We'll learn about why we need DNS and how it works. We'll also show you why DHCP makes network administration a simpler task. By the end of this module, you'll be able to do describe how DNS and DHCP work, how NAT technologies help keep networks secure, and how VPNs and proxies help users connect and stay secured.

Learning Objectives:
- Describe why name resolution is important.
- Identify the steps involved with a DNS lookup.
- Understand the most common DNS record types.
- Explain how DHCP makes network administration a simpler task.
- Demonstrate how NAT technologies help keep networks secure and preserve IP address space.
- Describe how VPNs and proxies help users get connected and stay secure.

## 5. Connecting to the Internet
In the fifth module of this course, we'll explore the history of the Internet, how it evolved, and how it works today. We'll understand the different ways to connect to the Internet through cables, wireless and cellar connections, and even fiber connections. By the end of this module, you'll be able to define the components of WANs and outline the basics of wireless and cellular networking.

Learning Objectives:
- Describe various Internet connectivity technologies.
- Define components of WANs.
- Outline the basics of wireless and cellular networking.

## 6. Troubleshooting and the Future of Networking
Congratulations, you've made it to the final module in the course! In the last module of this course, we'll explore the future of computer networking. We'll also cover the practical aspects of troubleshooting a network using popular operating systems. By the end of this module, you'll be able to detect and fix a lot of common network connectivity problems using tools available in Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

Learning Objectives:
- Inspect common network connectivity problems.
- Use tools available in Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux to troubleshoot network issues.
